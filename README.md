# Tailee
A very basic tail implementation in C, used as a learning project more so than to be anything valuable. 

## Usage
Tailee has a very simple usage, and there are limitations in its implementation. If you pass multiple `-n` flags the it will only use the last one as one example.

```bash
./tailee [--help|-h] [-n <lines>] <filename>
```
